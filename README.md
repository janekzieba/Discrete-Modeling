**FILE : game_of_life_simulator.py**
This Python script implements **discrete modeling** through cellular automata simulations, specifically **Conway's Game of Life**, supporting patterns like Glider, Glider Gun, Oscillator, Still Life, and Random. It offers periodic or reflective boundary conditions and simulation modes: Standard (classic rules), Virus (infection spread with decay), and Battle (competition between factions). Visualizations are created with **Matplotlib**, saving animations as GIFs or displaying them via a **PyQt5** GUI. Configure the simulation interactively by choosing patterns, boundaries, and modes, and explore the dynamics of discrete systems.
