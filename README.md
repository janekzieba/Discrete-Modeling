**FILE : game_of_life_simulator.py**

This Python script implements **discrete modeling** through cellular automata simulations, specifically **Conway's Game of Life**, supporting patterns like Glider, Glider Gun, Oscillator, Still Life, and Random. It offers periodic or reflective boundary conditions and simulation modes: Standard (classic rules), Virus (infection spread with decay), and Battle (competition between factions). Visualizations are created with **Matplotlib**, saving animations as GIFs or displaying them via a **PyQt5** GUI. Configure the simulation interactively by choosing patterns, boundaries, and modes, and explore the dynamics of discrete systems.

**FILE : cellular_automaton_1d.py**

This Python script implements discrete modeling using 1D cellular automata simulations. It supports dynamic rule generation based on a user-provided album number and applies rules to evolve the automaton over a specified number of iterations. The simulation allows for periodic or absorbing boundary conditions, and the results can be visualized in the terminal or saved to a CSV file. Users can interactively toggle boundary conditions and explore the evolution of the automaton. The script is ideal for understanding the dynamics of 1D automata and experimenting with custom rules.


**FILE : SIMULATION.py**

This project is a dynamic simulation of terrain changes based on an input satellite image. The program visualizes processes such as flooding and fire, while allowing interaction during the simulation, such as adding dams or extinguishing fires. The code utilizes Python and libraries like numpy, matplotlib, Pillow, and animation.
